# Description

The MemCard PRO, in conjunction with the XStation ODE mod, is able to detect which game is currently running on your PlayStation 1. This simple python script takes that information and incorporates it with Discord Rich Presence to display the PS1 game you're currently playing on Discord.

# Usage

Before using this, you need to have set up your MemCard PRO's web server as per the MCP's instructions. You can then set the IP address of the MCP's local web server in config.txt if necessary.
